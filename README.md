## Collaboration
This project was developed by Tyler Short. Below is a brief description of the features implemented in this application.
### Highlight Features:
* Rendering all products: The home page is of the application will render every product in the database as well as those that are later added by users
* Creating a product: When a user is logged in, a button will appear in the navbar that will allow the user to create their very own product and be added to the list of already existing products.
* Editing a product: If the logged in user owns a product on the application a button on the product page will appear that will allow them to edit the details of that owned product.
* Deleting a product: If they so choose the owner of the product can delete that listing from the application and they will be redirected to the home page on delete.


* Rendering the shopping cart: When a user navigates to a single product page theyr are able to add that item to their existing cart which will then take them to their cart displayed with the rest of their added items.
* Deleting an item: When the logged in user that added a cart item wishes to do so they are able to remove a product from their cart, dynamically updating the price upon removal.
